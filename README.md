# Password Generator and Checker

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, this is a program written in C++ that allows you to generate a password or to check a password (kind of).

## Password generator
It generates a password with the following rules:
- it asks for a length
- it will contain a number and/or an uppercase letter and/or a lower case letter and/or a symbol.

(e.g. you could obtain a string without numbers or without uppercase letters)

The alphabet is: **0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!Â£$%&/?@#()[]{}***

## Password checker
It check if the password in input has:
- at least a number
- at least an uppercase letter
- at least a lowercase letter
- at least a symbol

It also checks the length of the string.
